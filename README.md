# Variable Scope

## Learning Goals

- Understand the differences between variable scope in Python and JavaScript
- Use local variables and global variables

## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll introduce the concepts of scope.

## Variable Names and Scope

Naming variables is hard, but it is important. We need our code to be as
descriptive as possible. Any other developer reading over one of our programs
should be able to understand what our code does. A big part of this is using
names that are sensible and descriptive.

## What is Scope?

Functions in Python create their own scope. "Scope" refers to the areas of your
program in which certain data is available to you. **Any variable created
outside of a function will be considered _global_ and made available to all
functions in your module. Any variable created inside of your function
(including parameters!) is considered _local_ and only available inside of the
function.**

Let's take a look at the following example:

```py
name = "Joe"

def greeting():
    print(f"Hello, {name}")
```

In this code snippet, we have a variable, `name`, set equal to a string,
`"Joe"`. Then we define a function, `greeting()`, that takes no arguments and
prints out the value of the `name` variable. Let's fire up the Python shell,
cross our fingers, and give it a go:

```console
> greeting()
# Hello, Joe
```

As we can see, the value of our _global_ variable was accessible inside of our
`greeting()` function. Let's try another example:

```py
name = "Joe"

def greeting(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}")
```

In this code snippet, we have a variable, `name`, set equal to a string,
`"Joe"`. Then we define a function, `greeting()`, that takes in an argument of
name. Are the `name` variable that is set equal to `"Joe"` and the `name`
variable we are using as a parameter (or argument) for our `greeting()` function
definition the same? Let's see.

If we call our greeting function in the following way:

```console
greeting("Sophie")
```

What do we expect to be outputted to the terminal?

In this case, the above function invocation would `print()` out `Hello, Sophie`
to the terminal. It is true that we are setting a variable, `name`, equal to
`"Joe"` in this code snippet. But we are not using _that_ variable anywhere else
in our code. The `name` argument of the `greeting()` function is just a
placeholder. It means: when we call the `greeting()` function with an argument of,
say, `"Sophie"`, set the variable `name` _inside of the function_ equal to that
string argument.

The `name` variable inside of the `greeting()` function is different from the
`name` variable that we set equal to `"Joe"` outside of the function. The
`greeting()` function has its own scope, and variables inside of it don't know
about variables outside of it and vice versa.

## Function Scope in Python

Just as in Python's global scope, JavaScript's outer scope rules would allow us
to use a variable in the outer scope in our function:

```js
const evilMonster = "Bowser";

function princessPeachsCastle() {
  console.log(`${evilMonster} is trying to kidnap Princess Peach!`);
}
```

And in Python:

```py
evil_monster = "Bowser"

def princess_peachs_castle():
    print(f"{evil_monster} is trying to kidnap Princess Peach!")
```

So far, we've been looking from the _global_ scope inward to the _local_ scope.
Let's take a look in the other direction:

If we define the following function to include a local variable:

```py
def practicing_function_scope():
  im_trapped_in_the_function = "You can't access me outside this function!"
```

Trying to access that variable elsewhere in our program, _outside of this
function_, will raise the following error:

```console
> im_trapped_in_the_function()
# NameError: name 'im_trapped_in_the_function' is not defined
```

## The `global` Keyword

Earlier, we accessed some _global_ variables, `name` and `evil_monster`, from
inside of functions. What do you think would happen if we tried to change a
_global_ value from a _local_ scope?

```py
change_the_world = "change yourself"

def change_yourself():
    change_the_world = "world changed"
```

When we enter this code in the Python shell and try to run `change_yourself()`,
we don't see the change we're seeking:

```console
> change_yourself()
> print(change_the_world)
# change yourself
```

To change the value of a _global_ variable from a _local_ scope, we need to use
the `global` keyword:

```py
change_the_world = "change yourself"

def change_yourself():
    global change_the_world
    change_the_world = "world changed"
```

Now when we run our function again, we should see the desired output:

```console
> change_yourself()
> print(change_the_world)
# world changed
```

> NOTE: It is **very rare** that you will use the `global` keyword in your
> code; Python's scope rules help provide predictable behavior and easier paths
> to follow backward to find bugs. Only override those rules when absolutely
> necessary!

## Conclusion

Remember: A local variable defined inside a function can't leave that function.
It is not available to your program outside of the function. A global variable
defined outside of a function is accessible inside the function, just as in
JavaScript. Global variables can only be _modified_ from the global scope or
by using the `global` keyword.
